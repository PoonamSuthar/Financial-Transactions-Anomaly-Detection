## Overview

This project involves reading a dataset of financial transactions, performing statistical analysis, detecting anomalies based on unusual patterns, and generating a report of detected anomalies.

## Requirements

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

## Project Specifications

### Data Preprocessing

- Load and preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and standardized.
- Identify and handle missing or corrupt data entries.

### Statistical Analysis

- Calculate basic statistical metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation for transaction amounts by categories.
- Establish thresholds for detecting outliers based on statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR).

### Anomaly Detection

- Implement logic to detect anomalies in transactions based on the thresholds established.
- Anomalies could be unusually high transaction amounts, sudden frequency increases in transactions, or irregular patterns based on transaction history.

### Reporting

- Generate a report listing all detected anomalies with details including transaction ID, date, amount, and reason for flagging as an anomaly.
- Provide summary statistics on the number and types of anomalies detected.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Python environment
